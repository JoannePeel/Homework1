# Kickstarte-Excel-analysis
**Kickstarters**

By Joanne Peel

*Background*

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. For this project, a database of 4114 past projects was ordered and analyzed, with the finality of uncovering any hidden trends.

*Methods*

Excel dynamic tables were used to analyze the provided data set.

*Results*

The analyzed data set contained data collected between 2009 and 2017 and information about kickstartes from 9 categories, including film & video, food, games, journalism, music, photography, publishing, technology, and theater (Fig. 1.). The category with the most kickstarter businesses was the category “theater” (34%), followed by “music” (17%), “technology” (15%), and “film & video” (13%).

Figure 1. Kickstarters by category.

Of the 4114 kickstartes presented here, 2185 (53%) were successful, 1530 (37%) failed, 349 (8%) were canceled, and 50 (1%) are still live.
Forty-seven percent (1916) of the kickstarters did not receive the funding they pledged, and 80% of those (1530) failed, 18% (344) were canceled, while 2% (42) are still live. On the other hand, those that received 100% funding or more (2198=53% of total kickstarters), 94% (2065) succeeded, so that there is a strong relationship between funding and success.  
The most successful categories were” theater” (38%), “music” (25%), “film & video” (14%), technology (10%) (Fig. 2).

One limitation of the provided data set provided is, that monetary funds have been reported in many different currencies, making it hard to draw conclusions on this aspect.
However, 3005 of the projects were reported in US dollar, so the US kickstarters were used to analyze the relationship between success and funding goal (Fig. 3). Figure 3 shows that kickstarters that asked for less than 15,000 USD were more likely to succeed, while projects that asked for more than 15,000 USD were more likely to fail or get canceled.

However, some categories are have very high funding demands (Fig.4), such as “film &  video” or “theater”, but were at the same time successful categories, while “food” for example, had an average funding demand of 24,008 USD, but was one of the least successful categories.

Nevertheless, most of the businesses that succeeded (Fig. 5) had funding requirement of around 15,000 USD or below, with exception of the category “technology”. 
The general average funding goal for successful kickstarters was10,554 USD and a median of 4,000 USD, while the average for failed and canceled businesses was 56,508 USD and 710,630 USD, respectively.

*Conclusions*

1.	The most successful categories were” theater” (38%), “music” (25%), “film & video” (14%).
2.	There is a strong relationship between funding and succeeding, given that 94% of the businesses that receive 100% or more of the funds succeed.
3.	There is a tendency to be more likely to succeed if the fund goal is below 15,000 USD and the general average goal of successful kickstarters was 10,554 USD with a median of 4,000 USD.
